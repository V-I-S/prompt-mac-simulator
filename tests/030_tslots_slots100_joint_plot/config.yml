  description: |
    Each node tries to allocate a defined count of slots randomly.
    Success is obtained only when each of nodes hits at least one slot when only it does broadcast.
    Here the calculation is done to show results for optimal t, being less than n/k.
  model:
    network: TdmaNetwork
    node: TdmaNode
    executor: TdmaExecutor
  available-slots: 100
