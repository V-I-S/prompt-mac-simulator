  header: 019 Bernouilli Trials with variable amount of nodes, 100 static slots
  description: |
    Each node runs a Bernoullis trial for each slot independently, with given probability occupying the slot or not.
    Success is obtained only when each of nodes hits at least one slot when only it does broadcast.
    This experiment means to verify impact of non-optimal configuration.
