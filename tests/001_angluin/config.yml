  description: |
    Each node is randomly triggered to share its status with one of neighbours.
    Possible nodes' states are -1, 0 (neutral), 1. Each received message moves node
    1 step closer to the received opinion (receiving 1, it can change its state:
    -1 -> 0, 0 -> 1, 1 -> 1). Communication is directed and asynchronous.
