  header: 020 t-Slots strategy with variable amount of nodes, 100 static slots
  description: |
    Each node tries to allocate a defined count of slots randomly.
    Success is obtained only when each of nodes hits at least one slot when only it does broadcast.
    This experiment means to verify impact of non-optimal configuration.
